# Creating_a_token

This is a Solidity smart contract that implements a basic token system. The contract allows for minting (creating) and burning (destroying) tokens. Below are the details of the contract and its functions.

## Requirements

1. The contract has public variables that store the details about the coin, including the token name, token abbreviation, and total supply.
2. The contract uses a mapping of addresses to balances to keep track of token balances for each address.
3. The contract has a `mint` function that takes two parameters: an address and a value. This function increases the total supply by the specified value and increases the balance of the sender's address by the same amount.
4. The contract has a `burn` function that works in the opposite way of the `mint` function. It takes an address and a value as parameters and deducts the value from the total supply and the balance of the sender's address.
5. The `burn` function includes conditionals to ensure that the balance of the sender is greater than or equal to the amount intended to be burned.

## Contract Details

The `MyToken` contract implements the requirements mentioned above. Here are the details of the contract:

### Public Variables

- `tokenName`: A public string variable that represents the name of the token.
- `tokenAbbrv`: A public string variable that represents the abbreviation of the token.
- `totalSupply`: A public uint variable that represents the total supply of the token.

### Mapping Variable

- `balances`: A mapping variable that maps addresses to their token balances. It stores the balance of each address as a uint value.

### Mint Function

- `mint(address _address, uint _value)`: A public function used to mint new tokens. It takes an address (_address) and a value (_value) as parameters. This function increases the total supply by the specified value and increases the balance of the sender's address (_address) by the same amount.

### Burn Function

- `burn(address _address, uint _value)`: A public function used to burn existing tokens. It takes an address (_address) and a value (_value) as parameters. This function deducts the specified value from the total supply and from the balance of the sender's address (_address) if the sender has sufficient balance.

Note: The burn function includes a conditional check to ensure that the balance of the sender is greater than or equal to the amount intended to be burned.

### Deployment

- Deploy it in Remix-IDE and check the above functions, it will work properly.
